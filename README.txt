===================== Steps to Run the Project ==================


Step-1 : Install Dependencies:
            Open a terminal in the project directory and run:
            npm install


Step-2 : Start the Development Server:
            Run the following command to start the development server:
            => npm run dev


Step-3 : Open a New Terminal:
            Once the development server is running, open a new terminal in the same project directory.

Step-4 : Start the JSON Server:
          To enable API functionality, start the JSON server by running:
          => json-server --watch server.json --port 3001


======================== !IMPORTENT NOTE ==========================

NOTE :
    => Without starting the JSON server, some functionalities may not work properly.

    => Ensure that the JSON server is running before testing the application.

    => Port 3001 must be used because it is required for the fake API.
